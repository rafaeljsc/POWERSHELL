_tags

~Explanation:
~
~You can use resource tags to "label" Azure resources. Tags are metadata elements attached to resources. Tags consist of pairs of key/value strings. In this question, we would tag each resource with a tag to identify each office. For example: Location = Office1. When all Azure resources are tagged, you can generate reports to list all resources based on the value of the tag. For example: All resources used by Office1.
