~Explanation:
~
~You can move a VM and its associated resources to a different subscription by using the Azure portal.
~
~Moving between subscriptions can be handy if you originally created a VM in a personal subscription and now want to move it to your company's subscription to continue your work. You do not need to start the VM in order to move it and it should continue to run during the move.
