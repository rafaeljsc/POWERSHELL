!Select the true statement:

%All statements are wrong
%All statements are right

_Each Azure subscription can contain multiple account administrators

~Explanation:
~
~You can assign additional account administrators in the Azure Portal.
~
~You need an Azure Active Directory account to manage a subscription, not a Microsoft account. An account is created in the Azure Active Directory when you create the subscription. Further accounts can be created in the Azure Active Directory to manage the subscription.
~
~Resource groups are logical containers for Azure resources. However, resource groups do not contain subscriptions. Subscriptions contain resource groups.
